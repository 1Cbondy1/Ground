This file is here to help Team 3 keep a simple, unified design and continuity throughout project one, Recycle oil.

TABS OR SPACES?
	We will be using tabs throughout this project, for all files regardless of it's purpoase

-CAMEL CASE OR SNAKE CASE?
	In this project, the html files will be using dash case. 
		eg. descript-input
	In this project, all js files will be using camel case.
		eg. descriptVariable
	In this project, all css files will be using camel case.

-COMMENTS
	In all js files, all functions will have a description above their definition, detailing their purpose and a basic synopsis of their operation.
		eg.
			/*
			This function is in control of setting the buttons for our main div to editable depending on the args.
			The first arg is a boolean that sets the visibility of the buttons to the arg passed.
			*/
	Comments in js will also be needed for plugs (See PLUGS)

-JQUERY
	In this project, we will be using JQuery for all interaction with the webpage.
	We will also use JQuery for its Ajax call functionality.

-WHAT CAN I EDIT?
	You may only edit the file for which you are supposed to be working on.
	For instance, if you are working in js you cannot change index.html to make it so that it is easier for you during testing. 
	Instead, create a test page for you to test your feature or bug test in an inviroment that is not going to be deployed.

-PLUGS
	Plugs are the end pieces in both html and js that are going to interact with eachother.
	A plug in html might be an input element with a unique id, whereas a plug in js might be an array or variable that gets used by another developer in another file.
	What set's plugs apart from other variables and elements is that they are meant to interact with other files.
	This is where the name plug comes from, as they plug into or offer a plug to other files.
	Plugs should have their own descriptive comment above where they are defined in js, that way it is clear what is interacting with what.
